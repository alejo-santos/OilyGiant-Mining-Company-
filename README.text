This project is for OilyGiant Mining Company, where my objective is to identify the optimal location for a new oil well. The process involves the following steps:

- Gather oil well parameters for the selected regions, including oil quality and reserve volume.
- Develop a predictive model to estimate reserve volumes for new wells.
- Select the wells with the highest estimated reserves.
- Identify the region that offers the highest total profit based on the selected wells.

Using data from three regions, where each oil well's parameters are already provided, I will build a model to identify the region with the best profit margin. Additionally, I will analyze potential profit and associated risks using the Bootstrapping technique.
